Currently working on using topology augmentation techniques to learn optimal Neural Network architectures for malware classification. This project focuses on classifying malware samples according to their family using advanced machine learning approaches.

The research involves:
- NeuroEvolution for Augmenting Topologies
- Topology augmentation methods
- Malware family classification
- Performance optimization of deep learning models

This project is part of my ongoing research in machine learning applications for cybersecurity.

A space-themed endless runner game developed during my internship at Sozo Labs, showcasing Unity game development skills and C# programming.

## Game Features:
- **Physics-based Movement**: Realistic space navigation
- **Projectile System**: Shooting mechanics with collision detection
- **Sound Design**: Immersive audio effects and background music
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Dynamic obstacle generation and collision system
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Increasing challenge as game progresses

## Technical Skills Demonstrated:
- Unity Game Engine proficiency
- C# scripting for game logic
- 2D/3D physics implementation
- Audio integration and management
- Game object lifecycle management

## Development Process:
- Learned Unity fundamentals in weeks 1-2
- Applied game development principles
- Implemented core game mechanics
- Polished user experience and visual effects

This project marked my introduction to game development and demonstrated my ability to quickly learn new technologies and frameworks.

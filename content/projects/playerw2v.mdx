A research project that applies Natural Language Processing techniques to soccer analytics by treating soccer events as a language and learning player embeddings.

## Project Overview:
- **Data Source**: Soccer event data from professional matches
- **Model**: Word2Vec for learning distributed representations
- **Application**: Player similarity analysis and performance comparison

## Key Achievements:
- Successfully adapted NLP techniques to sports analytics
- Generated meaningful player embeddings based on playing style
- Demonstrated similarity between players with comparable roles
- Provided insights into player positioning and tactical preferences

This project showcases the intersection of machine learning and sports analytics, demonstrating how NLP concepts can be applied to non-textual sequential data.

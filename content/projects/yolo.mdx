A capstone project developed as part of my Computer Science degree at UCT, focusing on semi-automating the tedious process of image annotation for object detection tasks.

## Technologies Used:
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: Real-time object detection
- **OWLViT**: Open-vocabulary object detection
- **Object Tracking**: Multi-object tracking implementation
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV and related libraries

## Features:
- Semi-automated annotation workflow
- Real-time object detection and tracking
- Support for multiple object classes
- Efficient annotation export for training datasets

## Impact:
This tool significantly reduces the time required for creating training datasets for computer vision models, making machine learning more accessible for researchers and practitioners.

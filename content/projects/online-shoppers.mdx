A machine learning project focused on predicting customer purchasing behavior using various supervised learning algorithms.

## Techniques Used:
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble method for robust predictions
- **Bagging**: Bootstrap aggregating for improved accuracy
- **Logistic Regression**: Statistical approach for binary classification
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Instance-based learning algorithm

## Dataset Features:
- Customer browsing behavior
- Session duration and page views
- Traffic sources and user demographics
- Seasonal and promotional factors

The project demonstrates the application of multiple machine learning algorithms to solve a real-world business problem in e-commerce.
